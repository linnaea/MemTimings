        <p><b>Notes on AMD's t(Rd/Wr)(Rd/Wr)(Sc(L)) parameters:</b></p>
        <p>
            I'm not entirely sure what tRdRdSc(L)/tWrWrSc(L)/tRdWr/tWrRd control or how they control RAM timings.
            My current theory is that tRdRdSc(L)/tWrWrSc(L) = tRdRd_dg(sg)/tWrWr_dg(sg) - 3 as otherwise these
            should not accept 1, 2 or 3 as valid settings(DQ/DQS bus would be busy carrying out another command
            at tCL/tCWL cycles after the commands are issued). AMD does not publish register/AGESA documentation
            so this is merely a guess.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following that tRdWr most likely controls both tRdWr_sg and tRdWr_dg, and sets them to tRdWr + 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            However this theory breaks for tWrRd, so what it does is not clear to me. If like previous timings
            this sets tWrRd_sg/dg then setting 1 makes no sense. Issuing READ while there is an WRITE in-flight is
            forbidden by spec and some RAM would lock up if you try that. Besides, on AMD tWTR is configurable.
            So um?
        </p>
        <p><b>Some rambling on Intel's tWrRd and tWTR:</b></p>
        <p>
            On Intel tWTR_S(L) = tWrRd_dg(sg) - tCWL - BL/2 <b>- 2</b><br>I'm not convinced on the "-2" part being there
            just because, but I don't know enough to figure out why it's there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also on DDR5, BL=16 and some utilities written in the DDR4 era would still assume BL=8 and show the wrong
            value for tWTR_S/L on Intel DDR5 platforms(tWTR_S/L DOES NOT EXIST on Intel). And maybe, just maybe, if your
            UEFI BIOS allows setting tWTR_S/L on Intel DDR5 platform it could also be calculating tWRPRE with the wrong BL.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when the new DDR5 AMD platform comes along(I'm writing this in Aug. 2022) and manages lower tWTR timing
            by exactly 4, it might not be that Intel's IMC is crap but because utilities are displaying tWTR wrong.
        </p>
        <p><b>Some rambling on Intel's tWR:</b></p>
        <p>
            TLDR: To set tWR on Intel, either set tWRPDEN = tWRPRE = tCWL + BL/2 + tWR, or set tWRPRE and disable power down.
        </p>
        <p>
            tWRPDEN is <b>T</b>ime between <b>WR</b>ite command and <b>P</b>ower <b>D</b>own <b>EN</b>able, as it implies
            this controls how soon can the RAM enter power down(pulling CKE low), not accept a PRECHARGE command, after
            it has accepted a WRITE command. If only tWRPDEN is set and not tWRPRE, this would only tune tWR when there's
            no more thing to do for the RAM and you have power down mode enabled. If power down is disabled setting tWRPDEN
            does nothing.
        </p>
        <p><b>In case you're browsing memory datasheet or reading SPD data:</b></p>
        <p>
            All the t(RdRd/WrWr/RdWr)_sg timings are lumped into one timing: tCCD_L. (<b>C</b>AS-to-<b>C</b>AS <b>D</b>elay <b>L</b>ong)<br>
            All the t(RdRd/WrWr/RdWr)_dg timings are lumped into one timing: tCCD_S. (<b>C</b>AS-to-<b>C</b>AS <b>D</b>elay <b>S</b>hort)<br>
            tCL becomes tAA.
        </p>
        <p><b>Where are the _dr and _dg timings?</b></p>
        <p>I do not want to add ranks/DIMMs, it's already complicated enough.</p>
        <p><b>What are the RAS/CAS thing?</b></p>
        <p>Commands are encoded onto the RAS/CAS/WE/AP signal lines(see cycle table). RAS/CAS refers to 2 of the lines.</p>
